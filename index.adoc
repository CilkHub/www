Welcome to Cilk Hub!  Here you can find recent developments with the
Cilk multithreaded programming technology.

{underConstruction}

// As Moore's Law comes to an end, and with it the near-automatic
// increases in computer performance provided by semiconductor
// fabrication technology, obtaining program performance from software
// will become increasingly important.  By developing the Cilk
// technology, Cilk Hub aims to position Cilk as an effective open-source
// platform for next-generation multicore research.

== What is Cilk?

Cilk aims to make parallel programming a simple extension of ordinary
serial programming.  Other concurrency platforms, such as
link:https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/[Intel's Threading
Building Blocks (TBB)] and link:http://www.openmp.org/[OpenMP], share
similar goals of making parallel programming easier.  But Cilk sets
itself apart from other concurrency platforms through its simple
design and implementation and its powerful suite of provably effective
tools.  These properties make Cilk well suited as a platform for
next-generation multicore research.

The Cilk concurrency platform provides the following features:

link:programming[Simple language extension]:: Cilk provides a simple
linguistic extension to the C and {cpp} programming languages that
allows programmers to parallelize their ordinary serial programs
easily.

link:tapir[Compilation with Tapir/LLVM]:: The Tapir/LLVM compiler,
which is based on link:http://llvm.org/[Clang and LLVM], compiles Cilk
programs more efficiently than existing compilers for parallel
programming languages.

link:runtime[Provably efficient scheduling]:: The Cilk runtime system
implements a work-stealing scheduler that is guaranteed to schedule
the parallel program efficiently on whatever parallel processors are
available at runtime.

link:tools[Regression testing for determinism]:: The Cilksan
determinacy-race detector, packaged with Tapir/LLVM, offers provable
guarantees that enable effective regression-testing of Cilk programs
for determinism.

link:tools[Scalability analysis]:: Cilk supports efficient tools for
finding performance bottlenecks that inhibit a program's parallel
scalability.

link:tools[The CSI compiler-instrumentation framework]:: The
Tapir/LLVM compiler supports CSI, a framework that allows programmers
to develop their own dynamic-analysis tools to study Cilk program
execution.

// Cilk reducers:: The Cilk systems supports reducer hyperobjects, a
// flexible mechanism for implementing parallel reductions.

// support parallel programming for shared-memory multicore computers.
// Cilk provides a small, stable platform for investigating and
// developing multicore computing.  Cilk software technology enables
// rapid prototyping of ideas across many research areas, including
// computer architectures, algorithms, applications, software tools,
// languages, compilers, and runtime systems.

== In the works

There are several enhancements to the Cilk system currently under
development:

- A new implementation of reducer hyperobjects.
- Various parallel compiler optimizations.
- Performance enhancements to the Cilksan race detector.
- Improved scalability analysis and profiling.
- Sensitivity analysis.
- Enhanced documentation.
- Educational and teaching materials.
- Virtual image to make it easy to try out Cilk.
- Cilk software library.
- Cilk benchmark suite.
- Workshops and tutorials.
- Interoperability with Pthreads.
