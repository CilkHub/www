In light of

recent announcement] that they would no longer maintain
link:https://www.cilkplus.org/[Intel Cilk Plus], Cilk Hub is taking on
Cilk development.  The link:/tapir/[Tapir/LLVM compiler] is nearly
100% compliant with the Intel Cilk Plus minus the vector extensions
and is suitable for multithreaded task parallelism.  Tapir/LLVM also
supports some extensions to Intel Cilk Plus, such as the ability to
spawn statement blocks.
